# awsm
> AWS iMproved

## Intro
**awsm** is an alternative interface for Amazon Web Services. It is intended to streamline many of the tasks involved with setting up and scaling infrastructure across multiple AWS Regions.

## Origin
This application is the fourth rewrite of one of the tools I have built to make my duties as a one-man Infrastructure / DevOps team of Salon as agile as a much larger team. Each implementation has incorporated things I have learned during my career, with the motivation of promoting the use of more secure and redundant infrastructure designs by providing tools that automate many of the tasks involved with setting up and maintaining distributed AWS infrastructures.
